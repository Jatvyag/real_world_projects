# Real world projects

Here are examples of my real-world data analysis projects.

These projects were made as a part of my learning path at [![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/DataCamp%20-%20gray?logo=DataCamp)](https://www.datacamp.com).

You can open any Jupyter Notebook project file from this repository with Binder here: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Jatvyag/rwp/HEAD).
